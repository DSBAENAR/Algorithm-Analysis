    "# What is Big O Notation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Big O Notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity. It provides a way to express how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. Big O Notation focuses on the dominant term of the growth rate, ignoring constant factors and lower-order terms."

    "# Example of Big O Notation\n",
    "For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n^2 + 3n + 2)$, we can simplify it to $O(n^2)$ because $n^2$ is the dominant term as $n$ grows larger. This means that the algorithm's runtime will grow quadratically as the input size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterating a Matrix is an example of an algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix. This is because we need to visit each element in the matrix, which requires two nested loops: one for the rows and one for the columns. As a result, the total number of operations grows quadratically with the size of the matrix."
